I collaborated with Ani Harriott.

On Problem 1, we helped each other to understand what the question was explicitly
asking for and helped to differentiate between exposing a representation
and a representation invariant.

On problem 2, we discussed the basic functions of a graph and helped each other to
understand what a graph should and shouldn't be able to do as a result of reading
the spec and spec test script files. As a result of this, we helped to develop and
brainstorm methods that should and should not be present within the classes. We also
helped to verify how certain fields should interact or be referenced between classes.

On problem 3, we mostly helped each other to understand how test methods are
syntactically written. In addition, if one of us was having trouble writing
a test case or method, we helped each other talk out one another's thought
process and brainstormed solutions to the issue.
