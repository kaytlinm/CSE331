#List Line Child Test File
#Tests that a graph can be created and a set of nodes and edges can be added in the orientation of a single line and when
#asked to print the children of the first few nodes, only one child is printed out despite they're being children of their child.

created graph graph1
added node a to graph1
added node b to graph1
added node c to graph1
added node d to graph1

added edge edgeA from a to b in graph1
added edge edgeB from b to c in graph1
added edge edgeC from c to d in graph1

the children of a in graph1 are: b(edgeA)
the children of b in graph1 are: c(edgeB)
the children of c in graph1 are: d(edgeC)
