#List Multiple Children Test File
#Tests that a graph can be created, and a set of nodes and edges can be added in the formation of a tree (one parent node
#with multiple children nodes) can print out multiple children.

created graph graph1
added node a to graph1
added node b to graph1
added node c to graph1
added node d to graph1

added edge edgeB from a to b in graph1
added edge edgeC from a to c in graph1
added edge edgeD from a to d in graph1

the children of a in graph1 are: b(edgeB) c(edgeC) d(edgeD)
