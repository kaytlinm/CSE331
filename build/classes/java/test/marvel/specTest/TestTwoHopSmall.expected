#Tests that a path can be found between two nodes that are separated by one node.

created graph graph
added node B to graph
added node C to graph
added node D to graph
added edge x from B to C in graph
added edge y from C to D in graph
the children of B in graph are: C(x)
the children of C in graph are: D(y)

path from B to D:
B to C via x
C to D via y
